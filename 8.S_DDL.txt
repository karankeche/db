Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View,
1. Create tables Emp and dept with constraints(Primary key, Foreign key etc)
2. create views on any two tables using conditions.(with types of views)
3. Insert, Update and delete values from views
3. Create index called EmployeeId for the deptment table. Entries should be in ascending order by department
id and then by employee id within each department.
4. Create sequence on Employee id.
5. Delete index..

-- View joining `Emp` and `Dept` to show employee names along with department names, for example, for HR department

-- Insert into the `Emp` table
INSERT INTO Dept (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES (1, 'HR');
INSERT INTO Emp (emp_name, dept_id) VALUES ('John', 1);

-- Update in the `Emp` table
UPDATE Emp SET emp_name = 'Alice' WHERE emp_id = 1;

-- Delete from the `Emp` table
DELETE FROM Emp WHERE emp_id = 1;
